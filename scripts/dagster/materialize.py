"""Materialize a single asset partition in-process, under a debugger.

`dagster dev` runs an asset body three process hops away from your terminal (the
code-location gRPC server launches a run process, which the multiprocess
executor fans out again), so a plain ``breakpoint()`` in the op never gets a
usable stdin. ``dagster.materialize`` instead performs a single-threaded,
in-process run: the asset body executes in *this* process, so pdb and IDE
breakpoints behave normally.

Paired with IMAP_RUN_JOBS_IN_PROCESS the imap_processing CLI is also called
directly rather than shelled out to, which means you can step from run_job all
the way down into instrument code in one session.

Edit ASSET and DATE at the bottom to target something else - the partition key
is looked up from the date, since those keys encode repoint boundaries from
pointing_table and cannot be written by hand. Then:

    poetry run python -m pdb scripts/debug_materialize.py

or point your IDE's debug configuration at this file.
