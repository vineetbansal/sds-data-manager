# Download scripts

One script per kind of file. Each takes a required start date and an optional
end date (`YYYYMMDD`, end defaulting to today) and downloads into
`imap_data_access.config["DATA_DIR"]`, which `IMAP_DATA_DIR` sets. Files already
on disk are skipped, so re-running a script tops up the archive rather than
fetching it again. `--dry-run` lists what would be fetched.

| Script | Files | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `spice.py` | SPICE kernels | `/spice-query` |
| `tables.py` | Repoint, spin and thruster | `/repoint-table`, `/spin-table`, `/small-forces-table` |
| `science.py` | Instrument science data | `/query?table=science` |
| `ancillary.py` | Calibration and configuration | `/query?table=ancillary` |
| `oneoff.py` | Specific products or named files | `/query?table=science` |

```sh
python scripts/download/spice.py 20251104 --minimal
python scripts/download/tables.py 20251104 --types repoint spin
python scripts/download/science.py 20251104 --instrument lo --data-level l0
python scripts/download/science.py 20251104 --product lo l1b histrates
python scripts/download/ancillary.py 20251104 --instrument lo
python scripts/download/oneoff.py 20251104 --product lo l1b histrates
```

Downloading only puts files on disk. To make them visible to the local database
(and so to the query APIs and the Dagster sensors), index them afterwards with
`scripts/index.py`, which needs the sds-data-manager environment:

```sh
../sds-data-manager/.venv/bin/python scripts/download/index.py --dry-run
../sds-data-manager/.venv/bin/python scripts/download/index.py
../sds-data-manager/.venv/bin/python scripts/download/index.py --create-tables  # empty db
```

`--create-tables` builds any tables that are missing and stamps the alembic
version, which is what an emptied-out database needs: alembic's own root
revision begins by altering tables that nothing in the chain creates, so
`alembic upgrade head` cannot build the schema from nothing.

Notes:

- **Authentication.** `IMAP_API_KEY` (or `IMAP_ACCESS_TOKEN`) selects the
  authenticated endpoints. Without one the archive answers science and ancillary
  queries with an empty list rather than an error, which looks exactly like
  having nothing to download; the scripts say so when they find nothing.
- **SPICE volume.** Kernels supersede each other, so downloading everything that
  touches a date range fetches far more than is needed. `spice.py` keeps only
  the newest version of each kernel by default, and `--minimal` additionally
  drops kernels that a more recently ingested kernel of the same type already
  covers. For a three month range that is the difference between ~360 files and
  ~24.
- **Repoint, spin and thruster files** land under `imap/spice/` but come from
  their own tables rather than the kernel table, which is why `tables.py` is
  separate from `spice.py`. Those endpoints ignore most of their own date
  parameters, so it filters client side.
- **Raw packets** come from WebPODA rather than the SDC archive. Use
  `scripts/01webpoda_download.py`.
