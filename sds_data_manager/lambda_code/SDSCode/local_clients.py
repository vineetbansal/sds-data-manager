        Parameters

        run_locally : bool
            When True, submit_job actually runs imap_processing.cli and blocks
            until it finishes. When False (the default) the command is recorded
            and logged but not executed, which is the safer way to inspect what
            the pipeline wants to do.
        timeout : int
            Seconds to allow a locally executed job before killing it. Only
            applies to subprocess execution; an in-process call cannot be
            interrupted this way.
        allow_upload : bool
            imap_job always appends --upload-to-sdc, and imap-data-access is
            normally configured against the real SDC with a live API key, so a
            local run would push locally-produced files to production. The flag
            is stripped unless this is explicitly set True.
        on_complete : callable, optional
            Called with the submission record after a locally executed job
            finishes. Used to stand in for the S3/Batch events that would
            normally trigger the indexer lambda.
        run_in_process : bool
            Call imap_processing.cli.main() directly instead of spawning a
            subprocess, so a debugger attached to the Dagster process can step
            into instrument code. Only meaningful alongside run_locally.

            This is a debugging aid, not a faster execution mode. Dropping the
            process boundary means spiceypy's kernel pool, imap_processing's
            logging configuration and any leaked memory now persist across every
            job in the run, and a crash in a CDF library takes the whole Dagster
            process with it rather than failing one job. Prefer the subprocess
            path for anything resembling a backfill.
